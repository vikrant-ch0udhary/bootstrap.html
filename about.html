                        computer (PC) with a screen and
                        alphanumeric keyboard. Laptops typically have a clam shell form factor with the screen mounted
                        on the inside of the
                        upper lid and the keyboard on the inside of the lower lid, although 2-in-1 PCs with a detachable
                        keyboard are often
                        marketed as laptops or as having a laptop mode. Laptops are folded shut for transportation, and
                        thus are suitable for
                        mobile use.[1] Its name comes from lap, as it was deemed practical to be placed on a person's
                        lap when being used.
                        Today, laptops are used in a variety of settings, such as at work, in education, for playing
                        games, web browsing, for
                        personal multimedia, and for general home computer use.</p>

                        in any and all industrial production or scientific research. Technology is therefore embedded in

                        machines, with or without the detailed knowledge of their function, for an intended purpose.

                    <p class="lead">Computer programming is the process of performing a particular computation (or more
                        generally, accomplishing a specific
                        computing result), usually by designing/building an executable computer program. Programming
                        involves tasks such as
                        analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and
                        the implementation of
                        algorithms (usually in a chosen programming language, commonly referred to as coding).[1][2] The
                        source code of a
                        program is written in one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers, rather than
                        machine code, which is
                        directly executed by the central processing unit. The purpose of programming is to find a
                        sequence of instructions that
                        will automate the performance of a task (which can be as complex as an operating system) on a
                        computer, often for
                        solving a given problem. Proficient programming thus usually requires expertise in several
                        different subjects, including
                        knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.</p>
